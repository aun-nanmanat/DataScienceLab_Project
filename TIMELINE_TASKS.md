# TIMELINE and TASKS

*(This file is for the management of the work. It can be deleted in the final version.)*

There are three informal presentations scheduled in the Data Science Lab (see [Schedule](https://cu-s24-msdssb-dsci-01-datasciencelab.github.io/Website/schedule.html))

1. Proposal Presentation (Feb 22 / Feb 29)
2. Progress Presentation (Mar 21 / Apr 4)
3. Final Presentation (Apr 29, May 2)

Check the [Information of Project Presentations](https://github.com/CU-S24-MSDSSB-DSCI-01-DataScienceLab/Course-Organization/blob/master/PRESENTATIONS.md)

## Your timeline notes

*Mark your presentation dates:*

1. Proposal: 21-Feb-2024 / 15:45
2. Progress: 21-Mar-2024 / 15:45
3. Final: 2-May-2024 / 15:45

*List a few milestones specific to your project*

- [ ] *Milestone 1* We would like to know whether more sophisticated methods within our datasets can lead to enhanced model performance and how to interpret such improvements. 
- [ ] *Milestone 2* We would like to know whether one model performs the best in one particular dataset, it would be the same for another dataset with the same method or not.
- [ ] *Milestone 3* We would like to know the impact of standardization and normalization techniques on the performance scores of our models. 
- [ ] *Milestone 4* We would like to know how to consider and analyze the trade-off dynamics associated with choosing between including all available features and employing feature selection techniques.
- [ ] *Milestone 5* We would like to know what approach can be employed to identify the optimal hyperparameters of each model.
- [ ] *Milestone 6* We would like to know if there is a risk of overfitting within our datasets, and what measures can be taken to effectively assess and mitigate this risk.
- [ ] *Milestone 7* We would like to know how to find the right balance of bias and variance in a model.

## Tasks

*Make your own tasks and update the list in your team. You can also use repository [Issues](https://github.com/janlorenz/Lab_Project_Template/issues) in your workflow (which is a common practice in many collaborative teams). 

- [x] Look into the project topic and define our goals/problems
- [x] Decide for and roughly explore datasets, including our target variable for each dataset.
- [x] Decide for models and methodology
- [x] Create a work outline, work plan, and work allocation 
- [x] Find materials (literature, academic paper, articles, etc.) to help us resolve our problems
- [ ] Start the human-readable project description file (quarto or GitHub-flavored markdown) make a structure of headlines and draft a few sentences for the abstract/executive summary
- [ ] Do preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- [ ] Script your data loading and cleaning (in the report or with an external script if it is too long)
- [ ] Look at the previous draft and machine learning modeling
- [ ] Look at the previous draft and explore hyperparameter tuning and feature selection
- [ ] Look at the previous draft and explore overfitting and the bias-variance trade-off
- [ ] Interpret the models and the logic behind them
- [ ] Finalizing code: Clean the code, remove unnecessary code files, remove unnecessary lines, and make a few helpful comments.
- [ ] Review all of the project and discuss
- [ ] Finalize your report
- [ ] Rewrite the abstract/executive summary
